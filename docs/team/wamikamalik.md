## Overview
#### Project: Nav@NUS
Nav@NUS is a desktop application that aids users in getting around NUS. The user interacts with it using a CLI and thus,
 this application is appropriate for users who can type fast.

## Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### New Feature: Find a bus route between 2 locations 
* What it does: it allows the user to find all direct bus routes between 2 locations.
* Justification: This is one of the main features of the product as it aids navigation by allowing the user to find all 
buses that go from one bus stop to another. It further eases the user's travel by displaying intermediate stops for each
 possible bus they can take.
 * Highlights: This feature forms the basis of the product and was challenging to implement as it required
 careful analysis of the type of locations that can be input by the user.
 
#### New Feature: Change description for your favourite commands
 * What it does: it allows the user to change the description for an existing command in the list of favourite commands.
 * Justification: This feature improves the ease of usability of the product as it allows the user to change description
 in one step rather than deleting the command from the list and adding it again with the new description.
