## 1. Setting up, getting started

Refer to the guide [Setting up and getting started](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F14-3/tp/blob/master/README.md#duke-project-template).

## 2. Design

This section describes the design and implementation of the product. It has been divided into two sections: Architecture 
and Implementation. 

### 2.1. Architecture

The architecture diagram given in the figure below explains the high-level design of the App. 

![Architecture Diagram](DG_Diagrams/Architecture/Architecture.png)

Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` is the class Duke.java. It is responsible for:

- Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and calling or creating objects in the order of execution.

The rest of the App consists of 4 main components:

- `Ui` : The Ui component handles all interactions with the user.
- `Logic` : The Logic component makes sense of the command and executes it.
- `Model` : The Model component is responsible for all data held in the memory.
- `Storage` : The Storage component handles data by reading from and writing to files in the hard disk. 

The sections below give more details of each component.

#### 2.1.1 Ui Component
The Ui component is responsible for getting the user input and for displaying appropriate messages as response 
to commands executed by the logic component. The following class diagram gives a brief overview of the Ui component 
and it's interaction with other components.

![uicomponent](DG_Diagrams/Components/UiComponent.png)

#### 2.1.2. Logic Component
The Logic component is responsible for the following tasks:
- Makes sense of the command entered by the user by splitting it into the command type and the parameters and/or 
delimiters if any.
- Executes a command based on its type and provides an appropriate result to the user via the Ui component.

The following class diagram briefly explains how different classes in the Logic component interact with each other.

<img src="DG_Diagrams/LogicComponent.png" alt="logiccomponent" width=1100 height=500>

#### 2.1.3. Model Component
The Model component is responsible for the following tasks:
- Stores the bus data, dine info data and favourites list in memory.
- Performs operations on the data to facilitate the command execution by Logic component.

The following class diagram briefly explains how different classes in the Model component interact with each other.

![modelcomponent](DG_Diagrams/Components/ModelComponent.png)

#### 2.1.4. Storage Component
The Storage component is responsible for the following tasks:
- Stores the favourite commands in a file in a certain format and retrieves this information everytime 
the user enters the application.
- Stores the number of times each bus stop has been typed by the user since he/she started using the application and 
retrieves it everytime the user enters the application.
    + This information is used to find out the user's most frequently searched location so far and display it to the 
    user. 
- These files are updated after every execution of a user command.

The following class diagram briefly explains how different classes in the Storage component interact with each other.

![StorageComponent](DG_Diagrams/Components/StorageComponent.png)

## 3. Implementation
This section provides details of how the main features of Nav@NUS have been implemented.

### 3.1. Finding a direct route (`/route` Feature)
`/route <location1> /to <location2>` is the command that has to entered by the user to see all direct bus routes 
available from **location1** to **location2**.

The class diagram in the figure below shows how different classes used for implementation of the `/route` command 
are linked to each other. 

![RouteCommandClass](DG_Diagrams/RouteCommand/RouteCommandClass.png)

The `RouteCommand#executeCommand()` method of RouteCommand Class executes the command in the following steps:
1. Calls `RouteParser#getLocations()` to get the locations entered by the user in the order of starting location and 
destination.
    - The `RouteParser#getLocations()` method throws an exception if the locations or the delimiter `/to` is missing.
2. Calls `RouteCommand#checkLocations()` to make sure location strings are not empty or the same.
    - The `RouteCommand#checkLocation()` method throws an exception if locations are empty or the same.
3. Calls `RouteCommand#similarityCheck()` to check if the locations are not in the list of bus stops but 
are similar.
    - The `RouteCommand#similarityCheck()` method calls the static `SimilarityCheck#similarLoc()` method and returns 
    a list of similar locations, if any.
    - If the list of similar locations is empty, `RouteCommand#executeCommand()` performs step 4 given below, 
    else it calls the static method, `Ui#printPossibleLocsMessage()`, to print the list of similar locations. 
4. Calls static `BusData#possibleBuses()` to get a list of buses with their routes from the starting location to 
the destination.
   - `BusData#possibleBuses()` calls `Bus#getPossibleRoute()` to check for a possible route for the given bus number.
   - `BusData#possibleBuses()` repeats this call for all bus numbers.

The following sequence diagram explains the above steps when the user enters `/route loc1 /to loc2`.

![Overview](DG_Diagrams/RouteCommand/RouteCommand.png)

The following sequence diagrams explain the interactions omitted in the main diagram.

![bus data](DG_Diagrams/RouteCommand/BusData.png)

#### Design Considerations

### 3.2. Full Route Display (`/routemap` Feature)

The `/routemap <bus code>` is the command that has to entered by the user to see the full bus route of a user-specified
bus route.

The class diagram in the figure below shows how different classes used for implementation of the `/routemap` command 
are linked to each other.

![RouteCommandClass](DG_Diagrams/RouteMapCommandClass.png)

The `RouteMapCommand#executeCommand()` method of RouteMapCommand Class executes the command in the following steps:
1. Calls `BusData#selectBus()` to find the user-specified bus in the bus data list. If found, the Bus object will be 
returned. Else, null is returned.
2. Calls `Ui#printFullRoute()` to display full route of the specified bus.

The following sequence diagram explains the above steps when the user searches for the full route of a bus.

![Overview](DG_Diagrams/RouteMapCommandSeq.png)

###3.3. List All stops (/liststops Feature)
`/liststops` is the command which prints all bus stops declared in the BusStops enum.

The `ListStopsCommand#executeCommand()` method of ListStopsCommand Class executes the command in the following steps:
1. Calls `BusStops#listStops()` to print out all stops.
    - The `BusStops#listStops()` method iterate through all bus stops declared in the BusStops enum class.
    - Alternative names for bus stops will also be printed if it has one.
    
### 3.4. Favourite command adder (`/addfav` Feature)

`/addfav <description>` is the command that has to be entered by the user to add a previous valid command in to the user's 
list of favourites.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the steps taken by the program when the user calls the `/addfav` command.
![add favourites](DG_Diagrams/AddFavSequence.png)

The `AddFavCommand#executeCommand()` method of AddFavCommand Class executes the command in the following steps:
1. The `AddFavCommand#executeCommand` method throws an exception if the command to be saved in FavList is missing.
2. Calls `AddFavCommand#createFav()` to make a new Fav object to be saved in the FavList.
    - The `AddFavCommand#createFav()` method creates a Fav object with its command saved as its description if 
    the user left description empty.
3. Calls `AddFavCommand#addToFavList()` method to add the Fav object created to the Favlist.
    - The `AddFavCommand#createFav()` method calls the contains method within Favlist to check for any duplicate
    Fav objects within the list that contains the same command.
    - If the there are no duplicate Fav objects, Fav object created will be added to the FavList.

### 3.5. Favourite command executor (`/execfav` Feature)
`/execfav <index>` is the command to execute a command with the specific index in the list of favourite commands. <br>

The command is executed in the following steps:
1. The user calls `Parser#setUserInput(<UserInput>)` by entering the command `/execfav <index>`. The new user input is updated.
2. `Parser#extractType()` is called to instantiate `ExecFavCommand` and run the user command.
3. `ExecFavParser` is instantiated and `ExecFavParser#setIndex()` is called to parse the `<index>` input from the user.
    - `ExecFavParser#setIndex()` method throws an exception if `<index>` cannot be parsed into an integer or if it is blank.
4. `ExecFavCommand#executeCommand()` is called.
5. `ExecFavCommand#getFav()` is self invoked to obtain the required `Fav` object from `FavList`.
    - An exception is thrown if there is no `Fav` object in the specified index in `FavList`.
6. A new `Parser` object is instantiated to run the command in the `Fav` object.
    - If the command from the Fav object throws an exception when running, the exception will be caught in `ExecFavCommand#executeCommand()` and the `Fav` object will be deleted from the `FavList`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the steps taken by the program when the user calls the `/execfav` command.
![ExecFav_Sequence_Diagram](DG_Diagrams/ExecFavCommand/ExecFavCommand.png)

#### Design Considerations
##### Aspect: Choice of command object in FavList to execute
|**Approach** |**Choosing command by index in list (Current choice)**|**Choosing command by description in list**|
|-----|-------|-------|
|Implementation|Easy to implement as `Fav` object can be extracted directly through index in `FavList` |Harder to implement as description will have to be compared with all the descriptions of `Fav` objects in `FavList`|
|Bugs|There will be no conflict in which command is meant to be executed as all commands have a unique index|As different commands in the list can have the same description conflict over which command to execute can arise|
|User experience|Command to execute will be shorter|Command to execute will be longer|

The first approach of choosing the command to execute in `FavList` by index was implemented.<br><br>
Implementation of the first approach is easier as the required `Fav` object can be directly extracted through the index in the static arraylist in `FavList`.<br>
However implementation of the second approach is more difficult as the description of all the `Fav` objects in the `FavList` will have to be scanned through and compared with the required description. This may adversely affect processing time as well.<br>

Bugs for the first approach are easier to handle and limited. As all `Fav` objects in `FavList` have a unique index, the only bug to check for is whether the `<index>` keyed in by the user can be converted into an integer and whether the index is larger than the size of `FavList`.<br>
However the handling of bugs for the second approach is more difficult as the description of `Fav` objects in the `FavList` are not unique. This causes extra complications to allow users to be able to choose which command to execute amongst those with duplicate descriptions instead of executing the wrong command.<br>

User experience for the first approach will be improved as the command required is shorter than that of the second approach. This means users can potentially key in commands quicker. <br>

Therefore, choosing commands based on index (first approach) is easier to implement, more efficient, reduces possible bugs encountered and provides better user experience.

### 3.6. Favourite command description modifier (`/descfav` Feature)
`/descfav <index> /to <newDescription>` command allows the user to change the current description of their favourite command
at location **index** in the list to **newDescription**.

>Note: **index** is the index of the item in the list when the first number is indexed as 1. As a result, 
>we access this element in the ArrayList using **index** - 1.

The class diagram in the figure below shows how different classes used for implementation of the `/descfav` command 
are linked to each other. 

![DescFav class diagram](DG_Diagrams/DescFavCommand/descFavClass.png)

The `DescFavCommand#executeCommand()` method of DescFavCommand Class executes the command in the following steps:
1. Calls `DescFavParser#parseInput()` to check if the command message input by the user is valid.
    - Throws an exception if 
        + the input is empty.
        + the delimiter `/to` is missing.
    - Calls `Parser#splitCommands()` to separate the **index** and **description**.
    - Checks the validity of each parameter and throws an exception if 
        + both or either of the parameters have only spaces.
        + the given index is not a number.
    - If both inputs are valid, it assigns the input values to index and description variables.
2. Calls `DescFavParser#getIndex()` and `DescFavParser#getDescription()` to get the appropriate values input by the user.
3. Calls static `FavList#changeDesc()` to change the description of favourite at **index**.
    - Calls static `FavList#checkIndexAndDesc()` which throws an exception if **index** is out of bounds or if 
    **description** is the same as the previous description of this favourite.
    - Calls `Fav#changeDesc()` to update the old description to **description**.
    
The following sequence diagram explains the above steps when the user enters `/descfav 1 /to hello`.

#### Design Considerations

### 3.7. Dining options finder (/dine Feature)

`/dine <faculty>` is the command that has to be entered by the user to see all the dining options available in the 
specified faculty.

The `DineCommand#executeCommand()` method of DineCommand Class executes the command in the following steps:
1. Checks the user input and throws an exception if the input is empty.
2. Calls `DineCommand#checkFaculty()` method to check for a match between the data and user input.
    + Sets the `isFound` parameter to **false** if there is no match.
    + Sets the `isFound` parameter to **true** if there is a match.
        + Calls `Ui#printDineResult()` method to print the matching results.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the steps taken by the program when the user calls the `/dine` command.
![bus data](DG_Diagrams/DineSequence.png)

### 3.8 Find specific dining outlets (/dineinfo Feature)

`/dineinfo <outlet>` is the command that has to be entered by the user to see information of a specified dining outlet.

The `DineInfoCommand#executeCommand()` method of DineInfoCommand Class executes the command in the following steps:
1. Checks the user input and throws an exception if the input is empty.
2. Calls `DineInfoCommand#checkFoodPlace()` method to check for a match between the data and user input.
    + Adds any matching data to an ArrayList `searchList`.
    + Calls `Ui#printDineInfoResult()` method to print the matching results if size of `searchList` is more than 0.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the steps taken by the program when the user calls the `/dineinfo` command.
![bus data](DG_Diagrams/DineInfoSequence.png)

### 3.9. Bus at bus stop finder (`/bus` Feature)

`/bus <bus stop>` is the command to execute to see buses which stop at a specific bus stop.<br>

The command is executed in the following steps:
1. The user calls `Parser#setUserInput(<UserInput>)` by entering the command `/bus <bus stop>`. The new user input is updated.
2. `Parser#extractType()` is called to instantiate `BusCommand` and run the user command.
3. `BusCommand#similarLocations()` is self invoked and calls `SimilarityCheck#similarLoc()` which returns an arraylist of possible location.
4. `BusCommand#setBusStop()` is self invoked in which, if `SimilarityCheck#similarLoc()` returns an empty array list, `BusStops#findBusStop()` is called.
    - If `SimilarityCheck#similarLoc()` returns non-empty array list, `Ui#printPossibleLocsMessage()` is called and an exception is thrown.
    - If `BusStops#findBusStop()` returns null, an exception is thrown.
5. `BusCommand#executeCommand()` is called.
6. `BusData#getBusAtStop()` is called and returns an array list of buses.
7. `BusData#printBusAtBusStop()` is called to print array list of buses.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the steps taken by the program when the user calls the `/bus` command.
![ExecFav_Sequence_Diagram](DG_Diagrams/BusCommand/BusCommand.png)

The following sequence diagram explains the interactions omitted in the main diagram.
